<p>Are you confused between Reactjs vs React Native?<br> Which one is better among them?<br> Can you reuse Reactjs code in React Native?<br></p>
Let's explore the answers in this post/article comparing Reactjs and React Native.

Before comparing Reactjs vs React Native, let’s take a look at the small history of both of them. <br><br>

Reactjs and React Native which are right now powering some of the most <br> popular and widely used mobile apps and websites, have an interesting history: <br><br>

In 2011, when Facebook ads were expanding and bringing in newer, exciting <br> features, the engineering team realized that the constant updates were slowing <br>down their progress. Content cascading changes and updates forced the <br> developers to realign the entire app. As the team size expanded, the problems <br> grew in the same proportion. 
<br>
They had the right model, but the user-interface needed a revolution. <br>

At the same time, an engineer at Facebook, Jordan Walke, used XHP (an HTML <br> component library for PHP) to create FaxJS, which was the first prototype of <br> Reactjs. <br><br>

In 2011, Reactjs was deployed for Facebook’s timeline, and this was a big leap. <br>

In 2012, Instagram was acquired by Facebook, and then Reactjs was used for <br> their timeline as well.

    <h1><b>Reactjs vs React Native – Comparing the individual features that make both unique in their league</b></h1>
    <b>What exactly is Reactjs?</b><br><br>Reactjs is a JavaScript library that supports both front-end and server. <br><br>
    <h1><b>What features of Reactjs is its USP from a Business perspective? (Advantages of Reactjs)</b></h1><br><br>
    <b>Blazing Speed with DOM</b> <br><br>


    
From a business perspective, one of the USPs of Reactjs is its ability to bring in blazing fast speed for the applications and websites developed, using the DOM or Document Object Model. 

This is how it happens: React creates an in-memory data structure cache that computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser’s displayed DOM seamlessly. The programmer writes the code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, wherein in reality, only those sub-components which are changed are rendered. 

This gives an edge to Reactjs, compared to other platforms for developing mobile apps since speed is one of the important factors for making a successful mobile app.
<br><br>
<b>Component-Based Architecture Saves Time</b>
<br><br>Reactjs introduced the concept of component-based architecture, which enforces the reusability of components, and thus, saves an enormous amount of time. 
This component-based architecture takes individual pieces of a larger user-interface and converts them into an independent, self-sustaining micro-system.

Thus, for example, if any component within the Adset tab in Facebook Ads needs some major changes, then only that component will be reused and re-defined, rather than the entire UI of Facebook Ads.
